Angular example app for viewing github activity 
=======================

This is a an example AngularJS application for viewing github activity. The data is static, not live. well, one request is still using the github api. Also some of the code might be overly verbose or a there might be better ways of achieving the same goal in Angular. It's meant more for me to play with Angular rather than it being a serious app but feel free to make it better.
